// @version      1.3.1
// @description  Builds a local ledger of players' last-online times, cities, ranks and combat records from the profiles you open, and sorts it least-active-first. Fully passive: it reads responses the game already made and originates nothing. Includes a next/back walk so filling the ledger by hand is one keypress per player.

/*
 * DISCLOSURE (Politiko rules, Scripting Abuse clause)
 *
 *   Reads:    JSON bodies of /api/* responses via a passive fetch/XHR tap — only the
 *             ones the game requested on its own, on pages you are actively viewing.
 *             Specifically /api/people (roster pages) and /api/users/<name> (profiles).
 *             No DOM scraping.
 *
 *   Requests: ZERO. This script does not originate network calls to politiko.io.
 *
 *             Clicking a name in the panel, or a walk button, is navigation — not a
 *             request this script originates. It performs the same client-side route
 *             change as clicking that player anywhere else in the game, and the app
 *             then fetches the profile as it always would, once, because you clicked.
 *             Nothing is queued, paced, retried, or continued in the background.
 *
 *   Sends:    nothing, to anyone, ever. No telemetry, no remote config, no export
 *             off-machine. Everything stays in this browser.
 *
 *   Storage:  localStorage keys prefixed `pkpw:` — the observed player ledger, roster
 *             metadata, and panel settings. All local. Clearable from the panel.
 *
 *             As of 1.3.0 the ledger also keeps each player's city. Both sources are
 *             fields the game already sends: `location` on a profile you opened, and
 *             `location_name` on roster rows when the server is unlocking that column
 *             (`locations_visible`). Neither adds a request, and nothing asks for a
 *             location that was not already in a response on screen.
 *
 *   Alerts:   none. No notifications, no title flashing, no sound.
 *
 *   Personal data: the ledger holds other players' usernames and public profile fields.
 *             It never leaves this browser and must never be committed — artifacts/ and
 *             anything session-derived are gitignored for exactly this reason.
 *
 * HISTORY, stated plainly because the file used to say otherwise: versions up to 0.4.0
 * shipped an opt-in crawler that originated paced requests to /api/people and
 * /api/users/<name> to fill the ledger automatically. That is prohibited by the
 * scripting clause — items 2 and 5, penalty game ban — and it was carried as a
 * knowingly accepted risk from 2026-07-28. It is gone as of 1.0.0: the arming system,
 * the queue, the pacing and the request-originating code have all been removed rather
 * than disabled. What replaces it is the walk, which is just you pressing a key.
